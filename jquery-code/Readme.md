# jquery library practice
The purpose is to explore this library and hopefully learn from it
## jquery CDN
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, I am going to be using [google CDN](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js);

## CSP
CSP is a Content security policy, due to this some browsers will not load external JavaScript code for security reasons. Currently I have not yet authorized the browser to load external JavaScript code but it can run smoothly on chrome.
